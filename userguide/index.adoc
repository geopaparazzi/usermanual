Geopaparazzi is a tool developed to do **very fast qualitative** engineering/geologic surveys and GIS data collection. 

Even if the main aim is in the field of GIS data collection, it contains tools that can be 
of great use also to http://www.osm.org[OpenStreetMappers] as well as tourists that
want to keep a geo-diary.

The main aim of Geopaparazzi is to have a tool that:                                         

* fits in any pocket and can be always at hand, when needed
* gives the possibility to take geo-referenced and possibly orientated pictures
  during a survey, with further possibility to import them into
  GIS applications like http://www.gvsig.org[gvSIG] 
* is able to easily exploit an Internet connection, if available 
* is extremely easy to use and intuitive, providing just few important functions


The main features available in Geopaparazzi are:

* geo-referenced notes
* geo-referenced and oriented pictures
* gps track logging
* form-based data surveys
* easy export of collected data
