== Supported datasets
anchor:supported_datasets[]

Geopaparazzi's Map View supports several map types: vector or raster, editable or static. Also, maps can be pulled live from an Internet server, or be generated locally from a map data file for off-line operation. You can switch between these modes in settings.

There are two types of maps in Geopaparazzi: 

 * **basemaps**: the background map in the map view
 * **overlay maps**: vector maps that can be shown on top of the basemaps


The following sections will detail various map source types. In case you want to prepare tailored map datasets as map sources in one of below map formats, please refer to the <<datapreparation,data preparation section>>.

=== A word about "external" storages
anchor:external_writable_storages[]

From Android version 4.4 (codename KitKat) it is no longer allowed for applications to write to userinstalled MicroSD cards. Instead applications can still write to internal memory (often seen as sdcard also).

An external user-installed sdcard appears to geopaparazzi as readonly. Datasets copied on the sdcard on a pc can therefore only be accessed in readonly mode and will create crashes if the user tries for example to modify a feature attribute.

One less known thing is that if the data are kept inside the application's data folder, they can be accessed in read/write mode.

So for example, if one puts the dataset in the folder:

----
/storage/YOUR-SDCARD/Android/data/eu.hydrologis.geopaparazzi/files
----

it will be handled as if it was in the internal memory.


=== Basemaps

Basemaps can be of 4 different types:

* mapurls
* mbtiles
* Mapsforge maps
* rasterlite2


==== Mapurls: Custom tiles based maps

Mapurl files are simple text files containing definitions of tile sources, either local or remote. A mapurl file must have the file extension/suffix *.mapurl* to be recognized by Geopaparazzi.

===== Remote Tile sources

By default, Geopaparazzi is configured to load map Mapnik rendered tiles live from the Internet, from OpenStreetMap's tile server. Compare the contents of the included mapnik.mapurl file for how this is done. You can exchange the OSM tile server with any other tile server as long as it adheres to the Mapurl URL conventions. The basics are:

----
url=http://tile.openstreetmap.org/ZZZ/XXX/YYY.png
minzoom=0
maxzoom=19
center=11.42 46.8
type=google
format=png
defaultzoom=13
mbtiles=defaulttiles/_mapnik.mbtiles
description=Mapnik - OpenStreetMap and contributors, ODbL.
----

The mandatory information is:

* the url of the tile server, having:

  - *ZZZ* instead of the zoom level
  - *XXX* instead of the tile column number
  - *YYY* instead of the tile row number
  
TIP: This information can be tested also in a browser http://tile.openstreetmap.org/9/271/182.png has ZZZ=9, XXX=271 and YYY=182

* the minimum zoom level that is supported
* the maximum zoom level that is supported
* the center of the tile source
* the type fo tile server. Currently both http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service[standard TMS] and Google Maps based numbering of the tiles is supported by the line:
  - type=tms
  - type=google

* the backup mbtiles path. This one is used to save downloaded tiles in the
  local mbtiles database

WARNING: The user needs to make sure that the backup mbtiles path is in a writable folder (see <<external_writable_storages, a word about "external" storages>>) or else crashes might occur.

Also WMS works as remote source, as long as it can be accessed through an **EPSG:4326** projection. 

An example for the URL part is::

----
url=http://sdi.provincia.bz.it/geoserver/wms?LAYERS=inspire:OI.ORTHOIMAGECOVERAGE.2011&TRANSPARENT=true&FORMAT=image/png&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application/vnd.ogc.se_inimage&SRS=EPSG:4326&BBOX=XXX,YYY,XXX,YYY&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256
----

Important here are:

* SRS=EPSG:4326
* BBOX=XXX,YYY,XXX,YYY

Geopaparazzi will cache/store downloaded Mapurl tiles in a local MBTiles SQLite file, so pre-fetched tiles will remain viewable when Geopaparazzi is operated disconnected from a remote Mapurl source (in off-line operation).

===== Local Tile sources

Just like your mapurl configuration may reference an on-line/remote tile sources, your mapurl setting may reference a local tile source for off-line use. This way it's possible to load on any smart phone complex maps as for example the following map that has a technical basemap with shapefiles overlaid in transparency

To be able to load such maps, one needs to prepare the tiles properly. This can be done via in several ways as explained in the <<datapreparation,data preparation section>>.

The tile folder have then to be loaded in the same folder as the description of the tile source:

----
url=mytilesfolder/ZZZ/XXX/YYY.png
minzoom=12
maxzoom=18
center=11.40553 46.39478
type=tms
----

Nothing changes against the description for the remote source apart of the URL. The URL in this case represents the relative path of the tiles folder.

WARNING: Filesystems are known to have problems in handling large amounts of very small files. This the exact case of local tile sources. If the dataset is large, it gets very hard to move the data from and to the device. Therefore this method, even if still supported, is flagged as deprecated. The *MBTiles* datasource, explained in the next section, should be used instead.
 
==== MBTiles

MBTiles is a file format for storing map tiles in a single file. It is, technically, a SQLite database. See the http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MBTiles[openstreetmap wiki] for more information.

==== Mapsforge maps

The mapsforge project provides free and open software for the rendering of maps based on OpenStreetMap. It developed an efficient binary format for storage of OSM map data (usually with file extension **.map**), and is offering country specific .map files for download. Geopaparazzi is able to render map tiles locally from .map files and will cache rendered tiles in a local MBTiles store.

Apart from Mapsforge itself, openandromaps is also offering .map files but with a different data bias and different render theme.

===== mapsforge

These are the standard maps generated, maintained and distributed by the https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge[mapsforge] team and can be downloaded from http://download.mapsforge.org/[their server].

In their default style they kind of look like:

.The standard mapsforge map.
image::06_maps/01_mapsforge_maps.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

===== openandromaps

http://www.openandromaps.org[Openandromaps] generates maps following the opencycle 
theme, with isolines and more hiking related stuff. The map files are larger but worth every byte. Their http://www.openandromaps.org/en/download.html[download area is here].

With the Oruxmaps theme that is available from the download area, the maps look like:

.The openandro styled mapsforge map.
image::06_maps/02_cycle_maps.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

===== Apply a render theme

When rendering mapsforge tiles locally, Geopaparazzi applies render themes if they are found on the disk. In order to be found, the render theme XML file needs to have the same name as the map file. 
Ex, the above cycle map example has a:
    
    italy_cycle.map

and a:

    italy_cycle.xml

render theme file in the same folder as the map file itself.

==== RasterLite2

https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/librasterlite2/wiki?name=librasterlite2[RasterLite2] is a raster format implemented in the https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index[spatialite database].

At the time of writing it is released as development version and supported in Geopaparazzi for testing.


=== Overlay maps

The only datasets that can be overlaid on top of basemaps are vector maps
coming from a https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index[spatialite database].
