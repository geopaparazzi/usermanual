== Handling datasets from and for Geopaparazzi
anchor:datapreparation[]

Several applications can be used to prepare and evaluate datasets for Geopaparazzi. The current ones known are:

* gvSIG
* STAGE
* QGIS
* Spatialite GUI
* GDAL

=== STAGE 0.7

STAGE (Spatial Toolbox And Geoscripting Environment) is a standalone application 
dedicated to spatial analyses.

Related to Geopaparazzi, it contains functionalities to:

* Create **mbtiles** files from raster and vector sources.  
* Export geopaparazzi projects (version 3 or 4) to **shapefiles**, notes, profiles, and other details. 
* Convert geopaparazzi projects from version 3 to version 4.

==== Installation

STAGE can be downloaded from the http://git.io/stage_releases[github releases page].

Steps:

* copy the zip file in a folder:

 - stage_0.7_win64.zip for 64 bits Windows operating systems
 - stage_0.7_win32.zip for 32 bits Windows operating systems
 - stage_0.7_lin64.zip for 64 bits Linux operating systems

* unzip the file in a folder
* enter the unzipped folder
* run the Stage application (ex. stage.exe for windows)

==== MBTiles creation
anchor:create_mbtiles[]

For the creation of an MBTiles file from a set of GIS data, as shapefiles 
and tiff rasters, select the module: **GeopaparazziMapsCreator**

image::07_maps_handling/03_stage.png[]

The user will be able to add:

* up to 2 raster tiff or asc maps
* up to 5 vector shapefiles
* define the name of the new mbtiles dataset
* define the minimum and maximum wanted zoomlevel (zoomlevels > 18 start to take long time  to build because of the large number of tiles generated)
* the image type to use:
  - jpg: this should be used when photographic data are used (ex. aerial images)
  - png: this should be used when images are used (ex. technical maps)
* the output folder, inside which the database will be created

Once the parameters are set, the module can be launched by pushing the green **play button** in the top right toolbar.

In case of big data the user should consider to set the memory put available to the run module. This is done in the lower left combobox labeled **Memory [MB]**. The number to set is considered to be MegaBytes. A safe value to use is a bit less than the amount of RAM available on the computer.

For windows 32bit machines it is not possible to use more than 1000 MB due
to technical limitations of Java itself.


==== Converstion of Geopaparazzi data to GIS data

Through the module **Geopaparazzi4Converter** it is possible to export 
data from a Geopaparazzi project database.

image::07_maps_handling/04_stage.png[]

The only parameter to set are the input Geopaparazzi database path and the output folder. It is also possible to toggle the creation of some of the data contained in the database.

To run the module, refer to the <<create_mbtiles,mbtiles section>>.

How are the data are exported from the Geopaparazzi database?
The following is created:

- point shapefiles for each type of note also complex forms
- point shapefiles with reference to pictures taken and sketches
- all pictures are exported to a media folder
- line and points shapefiles for log lines and points
- profile charts and csv of log data
- a simple text project metadata file

=== QGIS

Using plugins, QGIS can import Geopaparazzi databases and create mbtile base maps.  At the time of writing (July 2018), QGIS 3 is newly released and most of the plugins that work with Geopaparazzi files have not been ported over from QGIS 2. 

==== Importing Data with QGIS 2

===== ExportGeopaparazzi Plugin

Install the ExportGeopaparazzi plugin from the QGIS repository. As this plugin is experimental, go to **Settings** in the **Manage and Install Plugins** dialog and check the **Show also experimental plugins** checkbox, or the plugin will not be displayed in the list of available plugins. The plugin actually mainly imports data from gpap files and displays the data in memory layers.  Separate layers are created for bookmarks, gpslogs, image positions and notes. Memory layers are not saved by default when the project closes so important data will need to be saved as another format. Additionally the notes layer includes all types of note. A single SVG symbol is used for all types of note. To generate different symbols for different types of note, the symbol type will need to be changed as the SVG symbol used comes in only one color. As all types of note are listed in the same layer, the attribute table does not have separate columns for each form field. All form data is presented in the style column in JSON format. Information imported this was is only useful for viewing.

===== GPAP to Vector Files Process
Algorithms for importing or export to Geopaparazzi can be added to the processing toolbox. The **GPAP to Vector Files** algorithm creates separate layers for each type of note, and creates layers for bookmarks, image positions and tracklogs. The algorith also saves images embedded in the gpap file to disk. Attribute tables for each type of note have columns for each data field collected by the note. If these layers are persisted, by saving them or dragging into a database (or saving as a shapefile), they can be used for GIS mapping and analysis. **Geopackages** are the current standard data format for QGIS and have the advantage of not truncating the names of forms or form fields, so save in this format if possible. The algorithms are installed with the **ExportGeopaparazzi plugin**, however the algorithms are not made visible by default. To make the tools visible, open the **Procession\Options** menu, click **providers** option and then open the **Import/Export to/from Geopaparazzi** option and activate the algorithms.

==== Viewing Data in QGIS 3
QGIS 3 does not at the time of writing (July 2018) have any gpap file importers. A workaround is to change the extension of the gpap file to **sqlite3**. The sqlite file can then be dragged and dropped onto the map window. The ‘Select Vector Layers to Add’ dialog will appear and all of the data tables will be displayed, including tables that are irrelevant from a GIS perspective such as the raw photo data table. Only the bookmarks, gpslogsdata, images and notes table contain data with coordinates. Select these tables and **OK** the dialog to add them to the Layers pane as non-spatial tables. Non-spatial tables can only be viewed as attribute tables and cannot be used as map layers. 

To convert non-spatial tables to GIS layers, use the **Create Points Layer from Table** tool in the **processing toolbox**. Even the gpslogsdata must first be converted to points. To create a gps trail, the point layer created from the gpslogsdata can be processed with the **Points to Paths** algorithm. Currently, there are no tools for creating separate layers for each form type. Form data, is encoded in json format in the Forms field and there is no way to format the data to make it easily readable. However the various types of form can be symbolised differently using the form name, which is stored in the ‘text’ field. This method is useful for seeing gps trails and where various form notes were created.

image::07_maps_handling/02_qgis.png[]

QGIS 3 can also be used as viewer for kmz files produced by Geopaparazzi although is it not quite as good as GoogleEarth. Add the kmz file to QGIS 3 and use **map tips** to display the data associated with each point in a popup. If the map tips are based on the **description** field, which contains html, then the map tips will render the html and present a formatted report for the current data point.

==== Other Alternative Import Methods
QGIS users can also install GV-SIG and use the Horton Machine spatial toolbox to convert gpap files to shapefiles which can be used in QGIS.

==== Making Base Maps in QGIS
The **QTiles** plugin in QGIS 2 can be used to create base maps in mbtiles format. Base maps with as many as 30 000 tiles (~3 GB file size) work well in Geopaparazzi. 

=== Spatialite GUI

The Spatialite GUI can be used to create spatialite databases from shapefiles.

You can find the application on the spatialite homepage, at the time of writing 
a good version for windows is version 1.7.1 available in http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/windows-bin-amd64-prev[this download 
area].

Open it and find yourself with:

image::07_maps_handling/01_spl.png[]

We now create a new empty database in which to load the shapefile data:

image::07_maps_handling/02_spl.png[]

You will be asked to save the database somewhere on disk. Once done, you should find yourself with something like this, but with different path:

image::07_maps_handling/03_spl.png[]

To then load a shapefil, locate the *Load Shapefile* icon:

image::07_maps_handling/04_spl.png[]

In this example I will import a set of shapefiles from the http://www.naturalearthdata.com/[Natural 
Earth dataset], in particular the following ones:

image::07_maps_handling/05_spl.png[]

that http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/[can be found here]. 

The import dialog is the important one to fill the right way:

image::07_maps_handling/06_spl.png[]

The really important things to take care of, are underlined in red:

* the SRID, i.e. the EPSG code of the data projection. If that one is not right, then you will not be able to see the data in geopaparazzi. Don't even hope in miracles!
* the Charset Encoding. Make sure to choose the right one. For example Japanese people might want to choose SHIFT_JIS if they want to see the labels rendered properly
* force the creation of the spatial index

If you then the push the ok button, you should find yourself with an ok message like this after the import:

image::07_maps_handling/07_spl.png[]

You are almost there, one last step to go.

Right-click on the database name and select the **Update Layer Statistics** command. 

image::07_maps_handling/08_spl.png[]

Depending on the amount of data it should keep your harddisk working for a bit. 
Don't think it finished unless you see a result like the following:

image::07_maps_handling/09_spl.png[]

Once this result appears to you, you are good to go.

Move the spatialite database to your device, fire up geopaparazzi and 
go directly to the <<spatialitedatalist,spatialite data view>> and load the database.


=== OGR 

http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html[OGR2OGR] can be used to create Spatialite databases supported by geopaparazzi using different datasources.

The command that can be used is similar to:

[source,bash]
----
ogr2ogr -f "SQLite" -t_srs "EPSG:3857" -dsco SPATIALITE=YES output_ortrans.sqlite ORTrans_public.gdb
----

NOTE: More info available https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/37715[here] 


=== GDAL

Geopaparazzi does not support reprojecting raster data sources on-the-fly, so the file must be warped to the proper projection before using it. To do it you can use
http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html[gdalwarp] command.

The target projection must be Google Web Mercator (EPSG code 3857); you must know also the source projection of the raster you are converting. As an example, if you have a WGS 84 projected (EPSG code 4326) input file, you will run this kind of command:

[source,bash]
----
gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:4326 -t_srs EPSG:3857 -r bilinear input.tif output.tif
----

To create the tiles you can use http://www.gdal.org/gdal2tiles.html[gdal2tiles.py] script, using as input your Google Web Mercator projected raster file::

[source,bash]
----
gdal2tiles.py output.tif
----

It generates directory with TMS tiles, that you can use in Geopaparazzi. In the root of the this directory you will find "tilemapresource.xml" file which contains all the information to build the .mapurl file:
