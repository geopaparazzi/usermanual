== The Main View

Once you launch Geopaparazzi, the dashboard appears.

All the features that need to be quickly accessed, such as toggling GPS on and off, 
creating a note or taking a picture, as well as visualizing the current position 
on a map, are accessible from the dashboard.

.The dashboard of geopaparazzi.
image::02_dashboard/00_dashboard.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

From the dashboard the following primary functions can be accessed:

* the action bar functions
* take notes
* view or modify the project metadata
* take a GPS Track
* switch to Map View
* import Data
* export Data

=== Action Bar
anchor:action_bar[]

The action bar, from right to left, presents the following functions:

* the main menu
* the general settings button
* the GPS and map information button

The info button shows information about the current selected map and the status of the GPS. If the GPS has acquired a fix, information about the position is given: 

.Information shown when tapping the info button.
image::02_dashboard/10_info_button.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]


NOTE: The GPS status icon can be of the following colors:
RED if the GPS is not switched on, ORANGE if the GPS is on but no fix was acquired,
GREEN if the GPS is on and has fix, but no log is being recorded and BLUE
if the GPS is logging.


=== The panic button

At the bottom of the view the orange **Panic Button** is visible. Once pushed it 
leads to the *panic!* view, which presents two buttons:

* the *PANIC!* button
* the *just send position* button

.The panic panel.
image::02_dashboard/20_panic.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The panic button sends a request for help SMS with the last available GPS
position to a phone number that can be configured in the <<settings>> of geopaparazzi.

If no number is configured, the system SMS dialog opens up with a precompiled message
and the user will have to select the contact to which to send the message:

.The system SMS dialog
image::02_dashboard/21_panic_sms.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The _just send position_ button opens up the SMS dialog directly filling in the position without any request for help message. It is meant for quick sending the current position via SMS so that it can be opened from Geopaparazzi.

=== The dashboard buttons

==== Notes

Geopaparazzi supports 4 different types of notes:

* text notes
* picture notes
* sketch notes
* form-based notes

To access them you can tap on the first icon of the dashboard,
the *take notes* icon. Once you tap on it, the *take notes* dialog 
appears:

.The view from which notes are taken.
image::02_dashboard/03_notes.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The switch button at the top of the view gives the possibility to
choose whether the note will be recorded with the **current GPS position** 
(in case GPS is on) or at the **current center of the Map View** (the crosshair).


At the right end of the actionbar the quick note buttons are placed. From left to right:

* The **Quick text note** button, which opens a simple dialog, 
  inside which the text note can be written. Want to save the note? 
  Tap on the *ok* button. Want to trash it? Tap on the *cancel* button.

NOTE: The position of the note is taken when the note view is opened, not closed, in order to have all the time needed to insert the text while moving. 

.The simple text note dialog.
image::02_dashboard/04_textnotes.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

* The **Quick picture note** button, which will launch the camera application 
  that comes with your android system which gives lots of
  possibilities of customization of the images size, focus and so on. 
  This has one drawback, which is the fact that we are not able to pick 
  the azimuth of the camera shot at the exact moment it is taken. 
  The azimuth is therefore recorded at the moment the camera application is closed.
  That means that to have a realistic azimuth, you need to take the picture 
  and stay with the device in the same position of the snapshot until 
  you have closed the camera app.

* The **Menu** button, which allows you to select **Simple Sketch** to draw on a small panel or select **Layout Settings** to change the Notes button layout and text size.

.The simple text note dialog.
image::02_dashboard/05_note_menu.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Selecting **Simple Sketch**, you can change stroke style, color, and width. The  sketch panel comes from the open source app https://github.com/valerio-bozzolan/AcrylicPaint[Acrylic Paint].
  
.An example of taking sketch note.
image::02_dashboard/05_sketchnotes.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

WARNING: Once a simple note has been saved, it can't be modified.

Selecting **Layout Settings** allows you to change the text size on the Note buttons and the number of columns.  This can be useful to make the dialog easy to read while in the field.

.The Notes List with one column and large text.
image::02_dashboard/05_note_large.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]


===== Form based notes

Form based notes are complex notes that allow for better surveys.
Some example forms are included in the base installation of geopaparazzi.

The **example** button in particular shows all the possible form widgets available:

.An example of form based notes.
image::02_dashboard/06_form_based_notes.png[scaledwidth=40%, width=40%]

The notes can be saved and modified at any time.

To understand how to create forms, have a look at the section dedicated to <<forms>>.

==== Project Information

The project view shows information about the project database.

It shows:

* the database file name
* the project name
* the project description
* project notes
* creation and last closing date
* the user that created the project
* the user that last modified the project

Apart from the dates, that are set by the system, all data can be changed and 
saved through the save button.

.The project metadata view.
image::02_dashboard/07_project_info.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

It is also possible to add additional metadata to the project information. The plus button at the right side of the actionbar opens an input dialog that allows the user to define a key, a label and a value for the new metadata entry:

.The new metadata entry dialog.
image::02_dashboard/07_project_info_plus.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]


==== GPS Logging

To start logging, the user simply has to push the **logging** button.

Once it is tapped, the user is prompted to insert a name for the 
log or to accept the one generated based on the current date and time
( log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS ).

It is also possible to attach the new log to the last created log by 
checking the box: *Continue last log*. In that case the proposed name 
of the log (or any user inserted) is ignored, since no new log is created. 

.The new log dialog. From here it is possible to continue the last log.
image::02_dashboard/08_start_logging.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Once logging has started, the logging button will turn orange and the GPS status icon blue.
 
.The stop logging button with its orange color.
image::02_dashboard/09_logging_on.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

To stop logging, the same button is used. Once tapped, the user is prompted 
to verify the action. 


==== Map View

The map view presents a map and a set of tools that can be used to navigate 
the map, make measurements or edit datasets. The various tools are presented 
in the section dedicated to the <<Map View>>.
 
.The map view.

==== Import


.The import view.
image::02_dashboard/13_import.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Geopaparazzi supports the import of:

* GPX datasets
* bookmarks
* WMS
* default Spatialite databases
* geopaparazzi cloud projects
* geopaparazzi Cloud Profiles


===== GPX

By tapping on the *GPX* icon, the user is taken to a simple file browser. 

.The simple geopaparazzi file browser.
image::02_dashboard/16_import_gpx.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The browser only shows folders and files with gpx extensions. On selection, the 
file is imported.

===== Bookmarks

Bookmarks can be imported from csv files that *must be placed in the root of the sdcard* and the name of which has to start with the part **bookmarks** and to end with the extension **.csv**.

Geopaparazzi will let the user select the files to import if more than one are available and load the bookmarks from there and import only those that do not exist already.

The format of the csv is: **NAME, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE** as for example:

----------------------------------------------
Uscita Vicenza Est, 45.514237, 11.593432
Le Bistrot, 46.070037, 11.220296
Ciolda, 46.024756, 11.230184
Hotel Trieste, 45.642043,13.780791
Grassday Trieste,45.65844,13.79320
----------------------------------------------

===== WMS

It is possible to import basemap configurations from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service[WMS getCapabilities] URLs.

.The WMS dialog.
image::02_dashboard/16_import_wms.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Once the _getCapabilities_ URL is inserted and the refresh button is tapped, the list of available layers is presented. The selected layer is then imported in the list of available tile sources.


===== Default databases

When tapping the default database import button, the user is asked to name the new Spatialite 
database to create. Let's use the default name proposed based on the current date and time:

.Creating A Default Spatialite Database
image::02_dashboard/19_mapsforge.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

The newly created database is **editing ready** and contains a layer of each type geomotry type (points, lines, polygon). Since it is a template db, the attributes table have been created as generic fields with names from **field1 to field20**. It is very generic and simple, but still of use when you have to quickly collect some data with attributes and have no database prepared..


===== Cloud Projects
Geopaparazzi Project files can be downloaded from a Geopaparazzi Project server.  To enable the import of projects from the Cloud, make sure you enter the settings in the <<Cloud Projects Sync Settings, Cloud Projects Sync Settings>>


===== Cloud Profiles
Profiles are a convenient way to group basemaps, overlays, note forms, and a project file.  Geopaparazzi Cloud Profiles must be downloaded from a Geopaparazzi Profile server (standard <<Profiles, Profiles>> can be created on your device).  To enable the import of Profiles from the Cloud, make sure you enter the settings in the <<Cloud server Settings, Cloud server Settings>>.  

Once your Cloud server Settings are set, and you press the Cloud Profiles button on the Import view, the server will send a list of Profiles available for download.

.Cloud Profiles List
image::02_dashboard/22_import_profiles1.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

image::02_dashboard/package_download.png[float="left"]
Select a Profile for download by pressing on the icon of the Profile.  This will start the download of the Profile and the files associated with the Profile.  The download may take some time depening on the size of the files.

When the download is completed, you can activate the Profile by using the Profile view from the Main View menu, selecting the <<Adding data to a Profile, Profile Info>> tab, and sliding the Activate profile switch.



==== Export

.The export view.
image::02_dashboard/18_export.png[scaledwidth=30%, width=30%]

Geopaparazzi supports the export to the following formats:

* KMZ
* GPX
* bookmarks
* images
* Project Forms to PDF
* geopaparazzi cloud projects


===== KMZ

It is possible to export all collected data to KMZ format. 

KMZ is well known as it can be visualized in the 3D viewer http://earth.google.com/[Google Earth].

In the export:

* the notes are placed as red pins having the first letters of the text content as label
* the images are placed as yellow pins
* the GPS logs are visualized as tracks

===== GPX

The lines and notes data are exported to GPX, creating tracks and waypoints.


===== Bookmarks

Bookmarks can be exported to a csv file that has to be called *bookmarks.csv* and 
are placed in the root of the sdcard.

Geopaparazzi will write to the file only those bookmarks that do not exist already in the csv. 

===== Images

Since images are kept inside the database, this export is handy if the user needs 
to use the images inside a different software. In this case all the images of the project are exported inside a folder and a popup message shows the folder path.

===== Project Forms to PDF

You can export your notes to a simple PDF document.  After pressing the "Project Forms to PDF" button you can select which notes you would like to include in the PDF file.  The PDF file created will be a the root of the device's file system and named "geopaparazzi_projectexport_" with a timestamp and a .pdf extension in the file name.


===== Cloud Projects
Geopaparazzi Project files can be uploaded to a Geopaparazzi Project server.  To enable the upload of projects to the Cloud, make sure you enter the settings in the <<Cloud Projects Sync Settings, Cloud Projects Sync Settings>>.
