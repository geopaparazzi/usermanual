== SMASH, the free and open source digital field mapping for IOS and Android

NOTE: If you are looking for the source code for the software of this project, https://github.com/moovida/smash[jump right to this link].

SMASH is a digital field mapping application developed to perform fast qualitative engineering/geologic surveys and GIS data collection.

The main aim of SMASH is to have a tool that:

* is open source and **works both on IOS and Android**
* fits in any pocket and can be always at hand, when needed
* gives the possibility to take geo-referenced and possibly orientated pictures during a survey, with further possibility to import them into GIS applications like gvSIG
* is able to easily exploit an Internet connection, if available
* is extremely easy to use and intuitive, providing just few important functions
